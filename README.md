# SC1015-Mini-Project

## Problem: 
What do aspiring musicians need to look out for to make a popular song? We explore a dataset of Taylor Swift's discography to determine the best predictors for a song's popularity.

## Data cleaning: 
To clean up the dataset, we will add an additional column to indicate whether a song is a Taylor's version of the song, as this attribute might be a potential predictor of popularity. We will also remove extraneous non-alphanumeric symbols from song titles, and rescale the data for 'instrumentalness' to values between 0 and 1, making it easier to train on.

## Exploratory analysis and data visualisation:
We will plot the data in heatmaps, box plots, violin plots, scatter plots, multi-variate scatter plots and more.

## Pattern recognition: 
We will then find the correlation coefficients of each pair of attributes and plot them in a correlation matrix.

## Machine learning: 
We will use the dataset to train linear regression, classification tree and etc machine learning models, then analyse the goodness of fit and prediction accuracies to determine the best predictors of popularity.

## Intelligent decision: 
Finally, with the results obtained, we will conclude what makes a song popular.
